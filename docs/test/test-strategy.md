#### Test Strategy Document:

**1. Objective**
Ensure the core functionality of the task and user event handlers is working as expected.
Confirm that all event handlers adhere to the defined event schemas and business logic.
Verify the data integrity and consistency across all event handlers.

**2. Testing Framework**
Mocha + Chai

**3. Test Directory Structure**
```
index.ts
setup.ts
state.ts

eventHandlers/task/create.test.ts
eventHandlers/task/delete.test.ts

**4. In Scope**

* Event Handlers: For each event, a corresponding test file will be created

**5. Out of Scope**

* Internal utility/helper functions
* End-to-end flows involving frontend or full stack
* Input schema validation (already enforced by Godspeed's event schema)

**6. List of Test Files**

### 1. test/eventHandlers/task/create.test.ts

#### Test Case 1:
     * Description: Create a task with valid title, description, and userId.
     * Rationale: Ensures the task is created successfully when all inputs are valid.

#### Test Case 2:
     * Description: Attempt to create a task with a non-existent userId.
     * Rationale: Confirms that the handler returns a 404 error when the user is not found.

#### Test Case 3:
     * Description: Simulate a database error during task creation.
     * Rationale: Guarantees resilience and observability through proper logging and fallbacks.

#### Test Case 4:
     * Description: Create a task and verify that it is stored correctly in the database.
     * Rationale: Confirms the event handler performs correct operations on DB.
```
### 2. test/eventHandlers/task/delete.test.ts

#### Test Case 1:
     * Description: Delete a task with a valid taskId and userId.
     * Rationale: Ensures the task is deleted successfully when all inputs are valid and the user is authorized.

#### Test Case 2:
     * Description: Attempt to delete a task with a non-existent userId.
     * Rationale: Confirms that the handler returns a 404 error when the user is not found.

#### Test Case 3:
     * Description: Attempt to delete a task with a non-existent taskId.
     * Rationale: Confirms that the handler returns a 404 error when the task is not found.

#### Test Case 4:
     * Description: Attempt to delete a task with a valid taskId but an unauthorized userId.
     * Rationale: Confirms that the handler returns a 403 error when the user is not authorized.

#### Test Case 5:
     * Description: Simulate a database error during task deletion.
     * Rationale: Guarantees resilience and observability through proper logging and fallbacks.

#### Test Case 6:
     * Description: Delete a task and verify that it is no longer present in the database.
     * Rationale: Confirms the event handler performs correct operations on DB.
